# express-locallibrary-tutorial

The main objectives were probably how to use a database in a site and learning what certain things do when they are installed. 

I had problems with heroku. My command pormpt wouldn't recognize it, which prevented me from being able to publish the site. Other than that I didn't really have any big problems during this project.

The main way I see myself using the knowledge I have taken from this tutorial is when I need to install something or I need to link something to a database.
